          In the late 1970's, as jogging and running become more popular, more
          terrain-specific shoes were needed. From road running to running in
          the hills and off-road, we introduce the Colorado style in 1980s, to
          address the need of the trail running enthusiast. In this faithful
          reproduction, the COLORADO EIGHTY-FIVEâ„¢ NM model inspiration from the
          original 1980's off-road and trail running shoes. This style features
          functionality of the original; like the airhole midsole design, which
          enhances flexibility and curled form outsole for cushioning and
          stability.
